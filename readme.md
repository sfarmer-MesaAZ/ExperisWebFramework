Experis Web Framework, EWF (pronounced "oof"), is a combination of common Web technologies that makes it easy to design, develop, and maintain cross-browser, responsive websites.

To get started, download the files, and open the HTML file at /documentation/introduction.htm in a modern Web browser (i.e. not older versions of IE). That doesn't mean we don't support older versions of IE â€” we do, but you'll need to run EWF through a Web server because we use Selectivizr to provide CSS3 support, and Selectivizr doesn't work with local files.

Included in the documentation is a Quick Start guide and our HTML/CSS style guide, which includes our recommendations for best practices.
