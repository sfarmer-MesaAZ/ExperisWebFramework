					<h1>Introduction</h1>
					<h2>What is Experis Web Framework?</h2>
					<p>EWF (pronounced “oof”) is a combination of Web technologies that acts as a responsive framework for website development. It provides CSS layout techniques that have become essential to modern Web designers. By creating a common starting point for Web projects, we can ensure design consistency, browser compatibility, and development efficiency.</p>
					<p>There are numerous CSS frameworks available already (960 Grid, Blueprint, Bootstrap, and Foundation, to name a few), so why create another? Well, we tried them, and each seems to suffer from at least one major problem. For example, 960 Grid doesn’t provide any styles for flexible layouts (responsive design). Others use negative margins or weird positioning effects for elements to line up nicely. In almost all cases, additional HTML elements are required to do even the simplist of tasks — such as adding a background to a row of elements or including borders around cells in a grid. With EWF, we take the best ideas from those frameworks and implement them in a way that works with almost any design.</p>
					<p>EWF is a work in progress and will continue to evolve as we use it in new projects and discover new and better methods of building quality websites.</p>

					<h2>Setup</h2>
					<p>Getting started with EWF is easy. Download the files and start building.</p>
					<p>Okay, so there’s a bit more to it than that; but that’s why you’re reading this documentation. Start your project by opening the <strong>sample.htm</strong> file and modify it by trying out the columnar and grid layouts. Check the <a href="quick-start.htm">Quick Start</a> page for details.</p>
					<p class="note"><strong>Important note</strong>: We use the SASS CSS framework to ease the creation and maintainability of CSS. If you aren’t familiar with SASS, don’t worry; you can ignore the .scss files and use standard CSS.</p>

					<h3>Photoshop Guides</h3>
					<p>In the “resources” folder, you’ll find a file called <strong>guides.psd</strong>. Feel free to use it as a starting point for your design by opening it in Photoshop or Fireworks (or any other software that supports the PSD format). Just be aware that this intended for a liquid/flex layout, so design accordingly.</p>

					<h2>Form Styling</h2>
					<p>Many CSS frameworks include their own set of styles for form elements (buttons, drop-downs, etc.). This is great for lazy designers, but it means that every website you create will look similar. Not only that, it will look similar to <em>every</em> website created with that framework.</p>
					<p>Each website should be unique to the client, and for that reason, we are not including specific form styles in EWF. Instead, we will recommend <a href="http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/">jQuery UI’s ThemeRoller</a>. jQuery UI provides many interface and form elements to improve user experience, and ThemeRoller allows the designer to customize fonts, colors, and other aspects of the elements.</p>
					<p>For more simplistic forms, where jQuery UI would be overkill, the designer should have no problems styling individual elements to fit the rest of the design.</p>
